# screeps-prototypes
Generic prototypes for the game Screeps

My main goal is to reduce the amount of function calls to expensive screeps functions by saving things to global variables that get removed at the end of the tick.

See sample.main.js on how to include them into your main.


Todo:
* Queue system(untested/unfinished)
* creep.moveMe function(untested/unfinished)
